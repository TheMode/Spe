# Spe
The goal of this project is to compile independent parts of your code into LLVM IR and interact with it directly from a Java interface. 
This should in theory allow applications to both take advantage of the JVM's flexibility, while having some highly specialized (and hot) code that could take advantage of AOT compiling.

This can be seen as the JVM version of [Unity burst compiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@0.2-preview.20/manual/index.html)

Contributions are highly encouraged, especially if you know things about compilers :)
